					We've been helping to keep drivers moving for years. 
					Here we'll share with you what we’ve learned about the most common causes of breakdowns and how to avoid them.
					If you've got a problem with your battery, there's a good chance it'll be down to lots of short journeys or a poor electrical connection. 
					Battery faults are the most common cause of breakdown.When your car is serviced, the garage should check that connections are secure
					and that the battery terminals are clean and protected from corrosion.If you don't make long journeys very often, your battery 
					won't have had much chance to charge. You can sort this out by charging it overnight, every 2 weeks or so. 
					That way, you'll be able to keep it running longer.

                <p  class="changep">
					Check your tyres' tread depth regularly. If you can see uneven tyre wear, your wheels might be misaligned.
					Get a tyre specialist to check, or take your car to a tyre centre.If you've got a spare wheel make sure that it's got plenty of tread and 
					that it's inflated ready for use – you never know when you might need it. Many cars now only have a tyre inflator and sealant kit. 
					If you have a jack, make sure that it is in good condition and easily accessible, along with any wheel removal tools and locking wheel nut adaptor.
					If you're driving with heavy loads make sure you adjust your tyre pressure to cope with the change. You can usually find this information in your handbook.
